# Copilot Prompt Log

This file records user prompts from Copilot sessions for reference.

## Session: 5 December 2025

### Context: Summarizing fmpfit development chat

**Prompt:** I want to summarise the chat to demonstrate how I use copilot in programming. I want all my prompts to be preserved. In the responses, remove all trivialities, commands that have been executed etc., but keep conclusions, summaries, and main points of your reasoning, including cases where you have misstepped and corrected yourself. In cases where I have corrected you or asked critical questions - make sure that there is enough detail included in your preceding answers that my question makes sense.

**Prompt:** In one prompt I quote you "scipy's nfev count already includes jacobian evaluations (they're counted as 1 each)", but this does not occur in the responses shown, you need to add more detail in the preceding answers.

**Prompt:** Ok, now add a section at the end summarising takeaways from my prompts - how they illustrate how to use an AI for coding in an efficient manner - or NOT! Feel free to give negative examples.

**Prompt:** I've added an instruction "Keep a record of all prompts in the file ftools/chat/log.md", will you be able to follow that?

> *Copilot response offered options:*
>
> 1. Create the log file at the correct path (`chats/log.md`)?
> 2. Update the instruction in `copilot-instructions.md` to use the correct path?

**Prompt:** 1 and 2

**Prompt:** Can you put all earlier prompts from this chat into the log file?

**Prompt:** Read and follow the updated logging instructions in the last paragraph
