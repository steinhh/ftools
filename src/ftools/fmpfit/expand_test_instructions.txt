I now want to make the test more realistic by adding variations in the true parameters:

The true mean should vary randomly between both ends of x. I.e. the peak of the Gaussian should fall randomly between the first and last pixel of x (inclusive). 

The true amplitude should vary randomly between 1 and 20.

The true FWHM should vary randomly between 2 and 5 pixels.

The initial guess for the amplitude, mu, and FWHM should be set based on the noisy data, not hardcoded:

The initial guess for mu should always match the center of the pixel with the maximum value after noise has been added.

The initial guess for the amplitude should be the value of that maximum pixel.

The initial guess for the FWHM of the gaussian should correspond to the distance between the first pixels to each side of the max pixel where the value drops to half the maximum value (after noise has been added). If there is no such pixel on one side, use a default initial guess of 3.0 for the FWHM.
