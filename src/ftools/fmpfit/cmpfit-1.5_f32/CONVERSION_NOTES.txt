CMPFIT-1.5 Float32 (Single Precision) Conversion
================================================

This is a single-precision (float32) version of the CMPFIT-1.5 library.
All double-precision (float64) types and functions have been converted to 
their single-precision equivalents.

Key Changes:
------------

1. Data Types:
   - All 'double' types converted to 'float'
   - This includes function parameters, return values, and struct members

2. Math Functions:
   - sqrt()  -> sqrtf()
   - fabs()  -> fabsf()
   - exp()   -> expf()
   - sin()   -> sinf()
   - cos()   -> cosf()
   - atan()  -> atanf()
   - pow()   -> powf()

3. Numeric Constants:
   - Updated to single-precision values with 'f' suffix
   - MP_MACHEP0: 1.19209290e-07f  (machine epsilon for float)
   - MP_DWARF:   1.17549435e-38f  (smallest normalized float)
   - MP_GIANT:   3.40282347e+38f  (largest float)
   - MP_RDWARF and MP_RGIANT updated to use sqrtf()

4. Float Literals:
   - All floating-point literals now have 'f' suffix (e.g., 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0e-4f)

Files Modified:
---------------
- mpfit.h    : Header file with type definitions and constants
- mpfit.c    : Main library implementation (2309 lines)
- testmpfit.c: Test program

Usage:
------
The API remains identical to the double-precision version, except all
double* parameters are now float* parameters. This is a drop-in replacement
for applications that can work with single precision.

Precision Trade-offs:
--------------------
- Single precision provides ~7 decimal digits of accuracy
- Double precision provides ~15 decimal digits of accuracy
- For many fitting applications, single precision is sufficient
- Single precision uses half the memory and may be faster on some architectures

Testing:
--------
The test program (testmpfit) has been verified to work correctly with the
float32 version. All tests pass with expected numerical results within
single-precision tolerance.

Compilation:
-----------
gcc -O2 -Wall mpfit.c testmpfit.c -o testmpfit -lm

No compilation warnings or errors are produced.
